# AI Threat Detection System

An advanced cybersecurity system that leverages machine learning to detect and respond to network threats in real-time.

## Overview

This project implements an AI-powered threat detection system that analyzes network traffic patterns to identify potential security threats. It combines anomaly detection, classification models, and integration with threat intelligence to provide comprehensive security monitoring.

## Features

- Real-time network traffic analysis
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Deep learning capabilities for complex threat patterns
- SIEM integration for enterprise security ecosystems
- Customizable alert notifications
- Visual dashboard for threat monitoring
- Threat intelligence integration

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

- Data Ingestion: Captures and preprocesses network traffic
- Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from network data
- Model: Implements various ML/DL detection algorithms
- Visualization: Provides intuitive dashboards for monitoring
- Integration: Connects with SIEM systems and threat intelligence platforms
- Notifications: Alerts security teams of detected threats
