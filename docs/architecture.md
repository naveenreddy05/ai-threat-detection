# AI-Driven Threat Detection System - Architecture

This document provides an overview of the architecture and components of our AI-Driven Threat Detection System.

## System Overview

Our system continuously monitors network traffic, extracts meaningful features, and uses machine learning to detect anomalous patterns that might indicate cyber threats. It consists of the following main components:

1. Data Ingestion Pipeline: Captures raw network traffic and preprocesses it
2. Feature Engineering: Extracts and transforms relevant features from network data
3. Anomaly Detection Model: Identifies unusual patterns in network traffic
4. Visualization & Alerting: Displays results and alerts on potential threats
5. API Layer: Provides programmatic access to system capabilities

## Component Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline

The data ingestion pipeline is responsible for:
- Capturing network packets from interfaces or PCAP files
- Extracting basic features from raw packet data
- Preprocessing data for analysis

Key components:
- NetworkCapture: Captures and parses network packets
- DataPreprocessor: Cleans and transforms raw data for analysis

### 2. Feature Engineering

The feature engineering module:
- Extracts advanced traffic features
- Creates flow-based aggregations
- Generates network graph features
- Applies feature selection for optimal model performance

Key components:
- FeatureExtractor: Extracts advanced features from network data
- PacketAnalyzer: Analyzes packet contents for deeper insights

### 3. Anomaly Detection Model

The anomaly detection module:
- Trains models on normal traffic patterns
- Identifies deviations from normal behavior
- Assigns anomaly scores to traffic flows

Key components:
- AnomalyDetector: Core detection logic using various algorithms
- ModelTrainer: Handles model training, evaluation, and persistence

Supported algorithms:
- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Local Outlier Factor
- Ensemble methods

### 4. Visualization & Alerting

This module:
- Visualizes traffic patterns and anomalies
- Provides real-time dashboard for monitoring
- Generates alerts on detected threats

Key components:
- TrafficVisualizer: Creates traffic visualizations
- AlertDashboard: Interactive monitoring dashboard

### 5. API Layer

The API layer:
- Exposes system capabilities through RESTful endpoints
- Enables integration with external systems
- Provides security and access control

Key endpoints:
- /api/models: Model management
- /api/predict: Anomaly prediction
- /api/capture: Network capture control
- /api/visualization: Traffic visualization

## Data Flow

1. Raw network packets are captured from a network interface or loaded from PCAP files
2. Basic features are extracted from each packet
3. Advanced features are generated through aggregation and transformation
4. The anomaly detection model scores traffic based on learned patterns
5. Results are visualized and alerts are generated for anomalies
6. All components are accessible through the API and dashboard

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in various configurations:
- Standalone Mode: All components run on a single machine
- Distributed Mode: Components can be distributed across multiple machines
- Cloud Deployment: Can be containerized and deployed in cloud environments

## Security Considerations

- API authentication and authorization
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Network data privacy protection
- Secure communications

## Future Extensions

- Support for encrypted traffic analysis
- Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- Advanced behavioral analytics
- Automated response actions
